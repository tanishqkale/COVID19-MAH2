<h2 class="city">WHAT IS COVID 19?</h2>
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.</p>
<p>The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.</p>

<h2 class="city">HOW IT SPREADS</h2>
<p>Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.</p>
